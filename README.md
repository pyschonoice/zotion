## Local Development

To set up Zotion for local development, you'll need to configure the following environment variables:

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
2.  Populate it with the following variables, obtaining the necessary keys from your Convex, Clerk, and EdgeStore accounts:

    ```
    CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your_convex_deploy_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_public_convex_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_public_clerk_publishable_key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_ISSUER_URL=your_public_clerk_issuer_url
    EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=your_edgestore_access_key
    EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=your_edgestore_secret_key
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
